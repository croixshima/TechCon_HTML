            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>Founded in 2010, TechCon has grown from a small local gathering to a major international conference. Our first event, held in a small community center, featured just a handful of speakers and about 50 attendees. Since then, we've expanded our reach and influence, attracting thousands of participants and some of the brightest minds in technology.</p>
